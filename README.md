# Digital-clock-and-timer
Smart Clock & Time Utility is a modern web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It includes a digital clock with date and greeting, a timer, an alarm with notes, and a world clock.
The app features sound alerts, vibration animations, and a dark mode using CSS variables.
All time updates run in real time using JavaScript’s Date and setInterval APIs.
The interface is fully responsive and requires no external libraries.
Open index.html in a browser and interact once to enable sound.
